I like problems, I like numbers, and I like turning problems into numbers. While I often use data science and machine learning in financial, economics, and business applications, my interests extend beyond these domains. This website serves as my playground for exploring whatever side-projects happen to catch my interest.

I'm a recent graduate with an MA in Economics from the University of Toronto and a BA in Economics and Business from the University of Waterloo. I've previously applied my data science and economics skills in positions with the Ontario Ministry of Finance, the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and the Conference Board of Canada. I am excited to see where my next opportunity will take me!

When I'm not sitting in front of my laptop coding and doing stats, you can find me being active (powerlifting, wrestling, and martial arts), cooking (and eating!), or playing guitar (poorly).

I hope you enjoy my website. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of my work-- I'm always happy to chat.

Viktor
